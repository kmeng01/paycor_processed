For employers with employees in multiple states, keeping up with numerous minimum wage rate changes can be a daunting task. While some states are on a schedule for annual increases to eventually reach $15 an hour, 12 states still adhere to the federal minimum. Although the federal minimum wage of $7.25 has not budged since 2009, nearly half of the country increased their minimum wages for hourly workers after January 1, 2022 to compensate their employees, and more than twenty will provide additional increases going into 2023.
