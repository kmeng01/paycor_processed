The 2022 EEO-1 Component 1 2022 reporting is tentatively scheduled to open in April 2023. An exact date has not been announced as of yet.
We’ll keep you posted on any further updates.
Need a refresher on what EEO-1 reporting entails? We’ve got you covered.
All private employers with 100 or more employees, all federal contractors and first-tier subcontractors with 50 or more employees, and all financial institutions/government depositories with 50 employees or more are required by federal law to categorize employment data by race, ethnicity, gender and job category.
The EEO-1 report is used to review employment practices, patterns, and identify any instances of workplace discrimination. The EEOC and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) review the EEO-1 report to determine which employers should be further evaluated for any compliance violations.
EEO-1 Component 1 data relates to job categories sorted by race, ethnicity, and gender. EEO-1 Component 2 data requires employers to include the hours employees work and pay information from their W-2 forms by race, ethnicity, and gender within 12 pay bands.
The deadline for covered employers to report 2022 data is tentatively set for April 2023. Note: this only comprises Component 1 data.
In the past couple of years, EEO-1 reporting deadlines have been hard to predict. For more than five decades, employers were required to submit the EEO-1 report by September 30 of each year. In 2018, that date changed to March 31. In 2019 and 2020, the deadline was delayed until October 25. The deadline for 2021 filing was April 12 and 2022 is anticipated to be in April as well, which hopefully indicates the deadline is stabilizing. 
In September 2022, California passed Senate Bill 1162 which expanded the requirements for annual pay data reports. In an effort to reinforce pay transparency and counter workplace discrimination, the new law requires covered employers (with 15 or more employees) to publish pay scales with job postings as well as to retain certain pay records. The California law aligns with established mandates in Washington, New York, and Nevada.
This law builds upon the previous Senate Bill 973 which required employers with more than 100 employees to file pay data reporting by race and gender to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing by May 10, 2023. The new bill now requires employers who hired 100 or more labor contractors to file a separate report identifying those workers. In turn, the labor contractors are now obligated to provide pay data to the reporting employers.
