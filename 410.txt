We’re committed to preparing accurate and timely W-2s for our clients. Here’s what Paycor clients need to know:
Paycor’s deadline to send W-2 information is February 1, 2021. We will start producing W-2s after your last payroll processing of the year or after your books are closed.
Please work with your payroll representative in order to process your W-2s as quickly as possible. Once they are produced, they will be available online. You will also receive an email once the information is ready to be viewed online.
