Your Step-by-Step Guide to Leaving a PEO
Many smaller companies work with Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) for HR, payroll and benefits services. This arrangement is known as co-employment, in which the PEO becomes the employer of record for tax purposes and the companyâ€™s employees technically work for the PEO. While it may appeal to some businesses at first (sharing the responsibility) once your clients dig a little deeper they may dislike the lack of options when it comes to HR and payroll.
We know the thought of switching from a PEO to a payroll provider can be intimidating, but Paycor has the expertise and technology to ensure a smooth transition. Download and share this checklist with your clients as a resource to help them make an informed decision.
