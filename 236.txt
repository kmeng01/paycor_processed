It’s a new year, and that means it’s time for payroll administrators to get up to date on the latest changes to 401(k) match limits. Much remains the same, but there’s a few key updates you’ll need to take notice of.
In 2023, your employees’ contribution limits for their 401(k) will increase to $22,500, up from $20,500 for 2022. And the total annual contribution amount (employee plus employer contribution) will increase to $66,000 from $61,000 in 2022. Most companies typically offer 3-6% in matching funds, but there is no limit to the amount an employer can contribute as long as the annual cap isn’t reached.
A very important aspect of your 401(k) program for you and your company’s employees to keep in mind: The total annual contribution amount is an individual limit meaning that it includes all 401(k) plans an employee has. It’s important to make sure they’re keeping a close eye on their annual total if they have multiple accounts.
No matter how much money an employee makes, only the first $330,000 is eligible for employer and employee contributions. This cap was put in place to help ensure retirement savings are equitable across the board for all employees.
The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) created the catch-up contribution provision so older employees could set aside enough savings for retirement. Your employees who are 50 and older qualify to contribute an extra $6500 a year to their account.
The IRS defines a highly compensated employee as:
Key employees are either:
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) requires employers to undergo 401(k) discrimination testing every year to ensure plans are not favoring higher-income employees over those who earn less.
